# Firebase Authentication Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Authentication: failing to properly handle authentication errors, specifically when the user provides incorrect email or password.  The `authError.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `authSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

The issue arises from neglecting to check the specific error codes and messages returned by the Firebase Authentication SDK. A simple `catch` block without error type checking yields unhelpful error messages to the end user.

The solution emphasizes the importance of checking error codes and providing user-friendly feedback based on these codes.
